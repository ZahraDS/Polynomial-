🧩 Approach
We implemented the Polynomial class using a linked list-based representation, where each term (coefficient, exponent) is stored in a dynamically created node.
The design follows OOP principles — encapsulating term operations inside the class and providing clean methods for:
Inserting terms
Displaying the polynomial
Adding and multiplying two polynomials
The main focus was to ensure modularity and reusability — separating declarations (Polynomial.h), definitions (Polynomial.cpp), and testing (main.cpp).

⚠️ Challenges Faced
Understanding how to properly separate header and source files in Visual Studio.
Handling term insertion in sorted order to maintain polynomial structure.
Managing dynamic memory and ensuring correct linking of nodes during addition and multiplication.
Resolving build and linking errors due to missing declarations or header misplacements.
